Looking at your code against the assignment requirements, I can see you've made a solid attempt that follows the overall structure well. However, there are several issues that would prevent the code from running successfully:

## Issues Found:

### 1. **Missing Imports**
- In `clustering.py`: Missing `from pyspark.sql.types import FloatType`
- In `visualization.py`: Missing `from pyspark.sql.functions import col`

### 2. **Data Structure Assumptions**
The biggest issue is in `chunking.py`. Your code assumes the IEDGAR dataset has a "sections" column that's already a map/dictionary, but the actual dataset structure is different. SEC filings typically come as a single text field that needs to be parsed to extract sections.

The IEDGAR dataset has columns like:
- `cik` - Company identifier
- `company_name` - Company name
- `filing_type` - Type of filing (10-K, etc.)
- `year` - Filing year
- `text` - The actual filing content (single text field)

You'll need to parse the `text` field to extract sections rather than assuming they're pre-separated.

### 3. **Section Parsing**
SEC 10-K filings have standard sections (Item 1: Business, Item 1A: Risk Factors, etc.). Your code should parse these from the text field. A simple approach would be to use regex patterns to identify section headers.

### 4. **Unnecessary Configuration**
In `main.py`, you're configuring Spark NLP but not using it anywhere in the code.

## Recommendations to Fix:

1. **Update chunking.py** to parse sections from the text field:
```python
def extract_sections(text):
    # Parse SEC filing sections using regex
    sections = {}
    # Example pattern for section headers
    pattern = r'(?i)item\s+\d+[a-z]?\.\s+[^\n]+'
    # Split and extract sections
    # ... implementation details
    return sections
```

2. **Add missing imports** to the relevant files.

3. **Verify dataset structure** by loading a small sample first and checking column names.

4. **Consider memory management** - loading all embeddings at once might cause memory issues. The sentence transformer model loading approach might need adjustment for distributed computing.

## What Works Well:
- Good modular structure with separate files for each step
- Proper use of PySpark DataFrames and MLlib
- Correct implementation of the processing pipeline
- All required visualizations are included
- Good use of caching for performance

The assignment requirements are mostly met in terms of structure and approach, but the code needs these fixes to run successfully with the actual IEDGAR dataset.
